## 1. Overview

This TSPEC designs the **decision ledger**: a config-gated block of already-closed decisions,
rendered into the review-loop reviewer dispatch prompt, plus adjacent rule text telling the
reviewer not to re-open an indexed decision without a High-severity finding citing evidence
outside that decision's own record (FSPEC §1, BR-1/BR-5).

### 1.1 Where it lands

Everything this feature adds lands in **one production file**, `pdlc/workflows/orchestrate-dev.js`,
which already exports `reviewerPrompt`'s caller `reviewLoop` and already carries the two shipped
precedents this design clones. That module is the only workflow source the engine vendors
(`scripts/capture-learnings-baseline.mjs`'s sibling constraint recorded as `DEC-LOOPECON-08`), and
REQ NG-6 forbids engine **runtime** edits under `pdlc/engine/`, so a new
`pdlc/workflows/lib/` module is not available to this feature either. The one file outside
`orchestrate-dev.js` is the config disclosure — `.claude/pdlc.config.example.json` plus its
engine-side disclosure test — which FSPEC Q-3 already decided is in scope and which REQ NG-6
explicitly preserves.

### 1.2 The two shipped precedents this design reuses, rather than reinvents

| Obligation | Shipped precedent, cited | How this feature reuses it |
|---|---|---|
| Per-key independent config fallback, fail-open | `parsePinCheckConfig` / `parseDerivativeStopConfig` in `pdlc/workflows/orchestrate-dev.js`, both structural clones of `parseLearningsConfig`, sharing the module-private `descendSection` two-level descent | `parseDecisionLedgerConfig` is a **one-level** descent, so it clones `parseLearningsConfig`'s shape directly (`degraded(sectionMalformed)` closure, `text == null` / `JSON.parse` failure / missing-block short-circuits, `boolField` / `nonNegativeInt` field validators) |
| A gated clause appended to the reviewer prompt, contributing **zero bytes** with the flag off | `reviewerPrompt`'s `findingGrammarPart` — `const findingGrammarPart = findingGrammar ? "\n" + findingGrammarClause() : ""` — threaded from `reviewLoop`'s `derivativeStopEnabled` | The index block and rule text are appended by the identical mechanism: one extra parameter on `reviewerPrompt`, empty string when off |
| An injector closure built once per run, called per dispatch, re-reading its corpus fresh each call, pushing a record onto a report sink | `buildLearningsInjector` / `gatherLearningsCorpus` / `renderLearningsBlock` in `orchestrate-dev.js`, wired at `main()` through `wrapperSeams._injectLearnings` | `buildDecisionLedgerInjector` / `gatherDecisionCorpus` / `renderDecisionLedgerBlock`, wired through `wrapperSeams._injectDecisionLedger` and threaded into `reviewLoop` |
| A committed byte-identity baseline captured from the merge base, guarded by hand-transcribed digests | `pdlc/workflows/__tests__/loopEconomicsBaselineGuard.test.js` with `__tests__/fixtures/loop-economics-baseline/{scenarios.mjs,MANIFEST.json}`, captured by `scripts/capture-learnings-baseline.mjs`'s `runCaptureScript` | The same harness and the same two-job guard shape, against a new fixture directory (§7.4, answering O-4) |
| Config-block disclosure in the example config with a matching engine-side test | `pdlc/engine/__tests__/learnings-config-example.test.js`, `loop-config-example.test.js`, `advisory-config-example.test.js` — one file per block, so an example edit cannot redden an unrelated engine concern | `pdlc/engine/__tests__/decision-ledger-config-example.test.js`, same shape (FSPEC Q-3) |

### 1.3 The single design risk, stated up front

The whole feature turns on one thing being right: the **recognition rule** (§3) must render exactly
the Baseline's measured extent — 41 project-level ids (`M-1a`, `M-1d`) and the per-directory
feature counts of `M-2e` — at the Baseline's `Verified at` commit, or AT-01 fails and
REQ-DECLEDGER-01 is not met. The rule is not a judgement call: §3 states it, and §3.4 records the
result of running it over the standing corpus, which reproduces `M-1d` and `M-2e` exactly.

Cost is small and bounded. There is no new dependency, no new file type, no new record shape, no
new operator-facing failure class, and no change to any round budget. With the flag off — the
shipped default — the module's behaviour is byte-identical, and §7.4 pins that against a committed
baseline rather than a same-branch comparison.
