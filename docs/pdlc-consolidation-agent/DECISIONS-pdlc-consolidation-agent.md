## 1. Context

The *do* of this feature is captured in `TSPEC-pdlc-consolidation-agent.md` and, shortly, in code.
This document captures the **didn't do, and why** — seven choices where a real alternative was
weighed during TSPEC authoring and review, each of which a future agent will otherwise reconsider
confidently and cheaply, because in every case the rejected alternative is the one that *looks*
obvious from the outside.

Two properties of the shipped runtime are the standing constraint behind most of them, and are
stated once here rather than in each entry:

- **The workflow runtime has no `process`, no `fs`, no `import`, no `fetch`** (`CLAUDE.md`,
  "Workflow scripts and the runtime build"; enforced by `pdlc/workflows/build-runtime.mjs` and
  asserted by `pdlc/workflows/__tests__/runtimeBundle.test.js`). Every OS capability the pass needs
  is therefore an `agent()`-transported seam declared in `pdlc/workflows/runtime-adapter.js`, and
  "add a seam" always means "add an agent prompt", never "call an API".
- **The adapter's verb set is small and closed.** At HEAD it ships exactly `rtWriteFile`
  (`runtime-adapter.js:802`), `rtAppendFile` (`:863`), `rtListFiles` (`:905`), `rtGit` (`:945`),
  `rtGhRun` (`:995`), `rtRunCommand` (`:1034`), `rtReadFile` (`:493`), `rtCheckFile` (`:817`),
  `rtHashFile` (`:613`) and `rtMergeWorktree` (`:1060`), wired through `rtDevInjections` (`:1086`).
  `grep -nc "unlink\|rm -f\|rmdir" pdlc/workflows/runtime-adapter.js` returns **0** at HEAD: there
  is no file-removal verb anywhere in reach. DEC-CONS-04 and DEC-CONS-07 both fall out of that
  measurement.

Project-level decisions read before writing this document: `docs/_decisions/DECISIONS-plugin-distribution.md`
(DEC-DIST-01, the runtime's limits are binding, not worked around), `DECISIONS-test-oracle-mechanics.md`
(DEC-ORACLE-02, an uninstrumentable path is recorded, never worked around; DEC-ORACLE-03, one canonical
double per gate), `DECISIONS-spec-layer-boundary.md` (DEC-LAYER-01) and
`docs/_constraints/DOMAIN-CONSTRAINTS.md` DC-08 (a deferral needs a named successor surface) and DC-10
(every decision carries a `Testability:` line). Nothing below contradicts any of them; DEC-CONS-02 and
DEC-CONS-07 are direct applications of DEC-DIST-01 and DEC-ORACLE-02 respectively.

## 2. Decision index

| ID | Decision, in one line | Reversibility | Load-bearing on |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-CONS-01 | The credential seam returns `boolean`, and the secret reaches `git`/`gh` only by shell expansion | easy (seam is new; nothing consumes a value) | NFR-2, AC-4.2 |
| DEC-CONS-02 | Reuse `resolveAdvisoryRung` (`orchestrate-dev.js:1833`) by adding an optional `skill` parameter | hard (edits a guard-set file every advisory dispatch reads) | AC-1.5, AC-1.6 |
| DEC-CONS-03 | Clone from `git remote get-url origin`, never from the working-tree path | easy (one seam argument) | AC-3.8 |
| DEC-CONS-04 | The marker take is observe-then-write (`_checkFile`, `_readFile`, `_writeFile`); no atomic take exists | one-way door at this layer (no `O_EXCL` transport) | AC-1.3 |
| DEC-CONS-05 | Two corpus enumerations pinned literally on each side; only the **predicate** is held equal by a differential test | hard (relaxes a REQ clause; raised as an erratum) | AC-1.1, AC-1.2, NFR-5 |
| DEC-CONS-06 | Widen `rtWriteFile`'s prompt alone to resolve an absolute path verbatim; leave `rtReadFile` untouched | hard (shipped seam every phase writes through) | AC-3.1, AC-3.8 |
| DEC-CONS-07 | Release is `_writeFile(markerPath, "")`; `_checkFile`'s `file_empty` is read as **absent** | one-way door while no removal verb exists | AC-1.3 |

Entries are numbered in the order the TSPEC weighed them (`TSPEC §13.1` rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13);
that section's remaining rows are dispositioned in §10 below rather than promoted here.

## 3. DEC-CONS-01: The credential seam returns a boolean, never the secret

_(pending)_

## 4. DEC-CONS-02: Reuse `resolveAdvisoryRung` by widening it, rather than restating the ladder

_(pending)_

## 5. DEC-CONS-03: The clone is cut from `origin`'s URL, not from the working-tree path

_(pending)_

## 6. DEC-CONS-04: The marker take is observe-then-write, not atomic

_(pending)_

## 7. DEC-CONS-05: Two enumerations, held by literal pins; one predicate, held by a differential

_(pending)_

## 8. DEC-CONS-06: Widen `rtWriteFile` alone to accept an absolute path

_(pending)_

## 9. DEC-CONS-07: Release writes `""`; `file_empty` is read as absent

_(pending)_

## 10. Alternatives considered but not recorded as decisions

_(pending)_

## 11. Consequences for downstream layers

_(pending)_
