**FSPEC ID:** `FSPEC-EDIST-01`

## 1. Purpose and scope

This FSPEC specifies the **observable behaviour** of the four things REQ-EDIST-01…06 ask for:
the compat handshake a run performs before it dispatches, the install/upgrade lifecycle on an
operator machine, the tag-driven publish pipeline, and the provenance a run leaves behind in a
consumer repo. It also carries the two **expected sets** the REQ deliberately parked here rather
than in a measurement file (§5): the required-check set (T-7) and the packed-content set (AC-1.3).

**Altitude.** Behaviour, decision points, business rules, expected sets, error text obligations.
Not here, and owned by the TSPEC: package layout, manifest schema beyond the fields the REQ
already fixed, flag and field names, module boundaries, workflow YAML, and every carrier decision
parked at O-9 and O-10. Where a rule below says "the run states X", it fixes *that X is stated and
is machine-checkable*, not the string.

**Two sources of behaviour, one product.** The engine executes the canonical workflow modules;
the prompts it dispatches are read from the **installed plugin** at dispatch time. Every flow here
treats the plugin as an external, versioned input that may be absent, present-and-compatible, or
present-and-incompatible — three states, never two.

**Grounded at HEAD.** Every claim below about shipped behaviour is either cited to a measured fact
(`M-ENG-*`) or to a symbol in the tree. Where this FSPEC describes behaviour that does **not**
exist yet, it says so in the flow that needs it and names the obligation that owns it.
