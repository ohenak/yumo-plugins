## 1. Overview, altitude and what this document owes

### 1.1 What is being built

Three behavioural changes to one shipped module, `pdlc/workflows/orchestrate-dev.js`:

1. the review budget narrows from **5 to 3** and becomes **absolute per document** rather than
   per invocation — the window runs `BUDGET` rounds from an **origin `W`**, not from wherever the
   branch's highest existing round happens to sit;
2. every halt of a document-typed review phase **maintains a `## Reset Region`** in that phase's
   post-mortem — appending its own `HALT-REASON:` line, stripping the spent `RESOLVED:` marker,
   and rewriting the Iterations heading to a two-integer render — under two content confirmations
   that fail closed into a **phase refusal**;
3. a **clearance gate** reads that region before the window is computed, and, on an operator's
   one `RESOLVED: yes`, appends exactly one answering line that moves (or re-affirms) `W`.

Almost none of this is new control flow. The zero-round budget halt is the **shipped** halt branch
(`reviewLoop`'s `if (iteration > endIndex)`) entered on its first pass with `startIndex > endIndex`;
the phase refusal is the **shipped** step-G shape (`recordPhase(… "❌" …)` then `haltError`); the
clearance gate is a new block inside the **shipped** `phaseGate`. What is genuinely new is one
region parser, one region writer, one report-row carrier, and the seam that row 18 will wire.

### 1.2 Altitude

This document states **where each rule runs, which symbol owns it, what its signature is, what it
returns on every input, and which existing symbol it composes with**. It does not restate the
behaviour those rules produce — that is FSPEC's, cited by branch id (`B-*`) — nor the requirement,
cited by criterion id (`AC-1.x`). Fixture construction, generation axes, call-count oracle
construction and the falsification ledger's contents are **PROPERTIES'** (`REQ-RCV-01` O-10);
the per-artifact lifecycle line is **PLAN's** (O-15).

Shipped behaviour is cited by measured-fact id (`M-*`) as the family requires, **and additionally
by symbol and line at the citation baseline `9486c81`** where this document asserts a fact about
existing code that a reader must be able to check — `REQ-RCV-01` NB-4's `M-*`-only discipline is a
rule for the *REQ*, and §2.7 records why a TSPEC must cite the source it is going to edit.

### 1.3 What this TSPEC owes, by obligation

| Obligation | Owed here | Discharged in |
|---|---|---|
| **O-5** | how AC-1.4's region survives every halt — loop-owned state, the clause order, the one-update rule over clauses 1 and 2, both confirmations, the fail-closed refusal | §5.3, §6.4, §7 |
| **O-12** | how `W` is resolved before the round window is computed; how the *region validates* predicate is supplied to the gate; the interim's **0-consultation** observable. The seam's **contract** is `REQ-RCV-07` O-12's and is **adopted, not restated** | §5.4, §6.2, §6.3 |
| **O-13** | (a) how test code obtains the effective budget; (b) the closed, five-class enumeration of width sites and the machine that compares it against a repo scan | §8 |
| **O-14**'s implementation half | threading *rounds this entry ran* to the loop's post-write step; the Iterations anchor, placement and not-found insert; the empty reviewer-verdict list; the no-re-author path | §6.4, §6.5 |
| **O-9** | named where it attaches (the post-mortem prompt) — the clause's **text** is FSPEC §9's and is not re-authored here | §6.4 step 2 |
| **O-11** | the rebuild's placement in the change | §2.1, §9.5 |
| **O-10**, **O-15** | **not discharged** — named where they attach | §9.6, §11 |

### 1.4 What this TSPEC deliberately does not specify

| # | Not here | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **T-N-1** | The *region validates* decision procedure, its `{reason}` selection, the torn-write residue analysis, the validation-failure refusal's strings | `REQ-RCV-07` AC-7.1–AC-7.5 (forward edge **X-06**) |
| **T-N-2** | The fixed-point and zero-delta tests, `blocking` and `panel-shape` cell population, S-3/S-11 emission | `pdlc-rcv-fixed-point-stop` |
| **T-N-3** | `growth-bytes` / `classification` cell population, `appendRoundAnchors`, `DOC-BYTES:` / `DOC-SHA256:` / `REVIEW-MODE:` | `pdlc-rcv-panel-topology` |
| **T-N-4** | Which verdict sequence produces convergence inside a granted window (FSPEC §11.4's clause fixes the *outcome*, not the fixture) | PROPERTIES |
