# TSPEC — pdlc-rcv-budget-stop

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Upstream | `REQ-pdlc-rcv-budget-stop.md` v3.1 → `FSPEC-pdlc-rcv-budget-stop.md` v1.3 → **TSPEC** |
| Downstream | `PLAN-pdlc-rcv-budget-stop.md`, `PROPERTIES-pdlc-rcv-budget-stop.md`, implementation |
| Cross-Reviews | `CROSS-REVIEW-{software-engineer,test-engineer}-TSPEC-v{N}.md` while active |
| LEARNINGS | `docs/pdlc-rcv-budget-stop/LEARNINGS-pdlc-rcv-budget-stop.md` |
| Shared baseline | `docs/_constraints/pdlc-rcv-baseline.md` — measured facts `M-*`, thresholds §3/§3.1, durable homes §3.2 |
| Shared catalogue | `docs/_constraints/pdlc-rcv-catalogue.md` — vocabulary §1, closed catalogue `S-1 … S-17` §2, row schema §3, row-B render §4 |
| Shared split record | `docs/_constraints/pdlc-rcv-split.md` — paired edges §5, shared arguments §5.1–§5.8 |
| Sibling | `docs/pdlc-rcv-reset-region/REQ-pdlc-rcv-reset-region.md` (**REQ-RCV-07**) — forward edge X-06; its **O-12** fixes the `validate` seam contract this TSPEC adopts |
| Target | `pdlc/workflows/orchestrate-dev.js`; `pdlc/workflows/lib/`; `pdlc/workflows/dist/` rebuilt in the same commit (O-11) |
