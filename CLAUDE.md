# yumo-plugins — CLAUDE.md

This repo is a monorepo of Claude Code plugins authored by Kane Ho. Each top-level directory is one plugin.

## Plugin structure

Every plugin follows this layout:

```
{plugin-name}/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json          # name, displayName, version, description, author
  skills/
    {skill-name}/
      SKILL.md           # the full prompt loaded when /plugin:skill is invoked
  hooks/
    hooks.json           # PreToolUse / PostToolUse / SessionStart wiring
    scripts/             # shell scripts called by hooks (bash, POSIX-compatible)
  README.md
```

`plugin.json` is the manifest. `SKILL.md` files are the authoritative prompts — edit them here and both interactive Claude Code sessions and the Ptah engine pick up the change automatically (no copies to sync).

## Plugins in this repo

| Plugin | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| pdlc | `pdlc/` | Product Development Lifecycle pipeline — REQ → FSPEC → TSPEC → PLAN → PROPERTIES → Implementation |

## pdlc specifics

### Skills (invoked as `/pdlc:<skill>`)

| Skill | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestrate-dev` | `skills/orchestrate-dev/SKILL.md` | Top-level pipeline orchestrator |
| `pm-author` | `skills/pm-author/SKILL.md` | Authors REQ, FSPEC; addresses feedback |
| `pm-review` | `skills/pm-review/SKILL.md` | Reviews from product lens |
| `se-author` | `skills/se-author/SKILL.md` | Authors TSPEC, PLAN, DECISIONS; addresses feedback |
| `se-review` | `skills/se-review/SKILL.md` | Reviews from technical lens |
| `se-implement` | `skills/se-implement/SKILL.md` | TDD implementation (supplements: SKILL-typescript.md, SKILL-python.md) |
| `te-author` | `skills/te-author/SKILL.md` | Authors PROPERTIES; addresses feedback |
| `te-review` | `skills/te-review/SKILL.md` | Reviews from testing lens |
| `tech-lead` | `skills/tech-lead/SKILL.md` | Parses PLAN, dispatches parallel se-implement agents (TypeScript) |
| `tech-lead-python` | `skills/tech-lead-python/SKILL.md` | Same as tech-lead for Python repos |
| `harvest-learnings` | `skills/harvest-learnings/SKILL.md` | Distils cross-reviews + post-mortems → LEARNINGS, then deletes harvested files |
| `consolidate-learnings` | `skills/consolidate-learnings/SKILL.md` | Merges LEARNINGS across features into project-level knowledge |

### Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Script | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `guard-harvest-before-delete` | PreToolUse: Bash | `hooks/scripts/guard-harvest-before-delete.sh` | Blocks deletion of any `CROSS-REVIEW-*` file unless `LEARNINGS-{feature}.md` exists on the branch |
| `check-scope-field` | PostToolUse: Write\|Edit | `hooks/scripts/check-scope-field.sh` | Warns if a skill output doc is missing the `Scope:` field |
| `nudge-consolidation` | SessionStart | `hooks/scripts/nudge-consolidation.sh` | Reminds to run consolidate-learnings if stale LEARNINGS files are detected |

### Artifact convention (for consuming repos)

pdlc expects:
- Feature artifacts under `docs/{feature-name}/` — `REQ`, `FSPEC`, `TSPEC`, `PLAN`, `PROPERTIES`, `DECISIONS` (conditional), `LEARNINGS`
- Cross-review files: `CROSS-REVIEW-{role}-{doc-type}[-v{N}].md`
- Post-mortems (non-convergence): `POSTMORTEM-{phase}-{feature-name}.md`
- Project-level context: `docs/_constraints/`, `docs/_decisions/`
- Entry: `feat-{feature-name}` branch, start with `/pdlc:orchestrate-dev docs/{feature-name}/REQ-{feature-name}.md`

### Ptah engine integration

The Ptah engine (`apps/orchestrator/ptah`) reads SKILL.md files by filesystem path via `ptah.config.json` → `agents[].skill_path`. Point each entry at this plugin's `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Editing a SKILL.md here updates both interactive and engine behavior — there is one source of truth.

## Adding a new plugin

1. Create `{plugin-name}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with name, displayName, version, description, author.
2. Add `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` for each skill with frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
3. Add `hooks/hooks.json` if the plugin needs hooks (can be `{"hooks": {}}`).
4. Add a `README.md`.
5. Update the `## Plugins in this repo` table in this file.
