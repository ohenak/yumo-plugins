// advisoryWaveGate.test.js -- PLAN A6-00 (batch 1, no deps).
//
// Pre-flight gate: asserts that the advisory-tier baseline shipped at HEAD
// still exports the seam surface later A6-* tasks build on. Existence only
// -- never shape. A red result here means the baseline drifted underneath
// this feature before a single line of new code was written; it must halt
// the pipeline immediately rather than surface as a confusing failure deep
// inside a later task.
//
// `pathsCollide` is deliberately NOT included in the export-existence table
// below: it is declared `function pathsCollide(a, b)` at
// `orchestrate-dev.js:4726` with no `export` keyword, and is referenced only
// internally (`orchestrate-dev.js:10961`). An import-based existence
// assertion against it would fail at HEAD -- not because the baseline is
// broken, but because the symbol was never meant to cross the module
// boundary. Its behaviour is proved transitively through A6-07's
// `ownedSetCovers` trailing-slash cases; A6-05 exports only `computeWaves`
// directly.
