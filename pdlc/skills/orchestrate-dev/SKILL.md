name: orchestrate-dev
description: Development process orchestrator. Runs the full PDLC pipeline from an approved REQ — parallel cross-reviews, feedback loops, spec generation, and implementation handoff. Implements Evaluator-Optimizer + Parallelization patterns from Anthropic's Building Effective Agents.

# orchestrate-dev — Pointer/Contract

This skill delegates to a workflow script. It does not run the pipeline itself.

---

## Invocation Contract

```
/pdlc:orchestrate-dev docs/{feature}/REQ-{feature}.md
```

- Input: path must match `docs/{feature}/REQ-{feature}.md` (directory segment and filename segment must agree).
- Returns: a final pipeline report object in main context — no intermediate agent outputs.

---

## Preconditions

- The REQ file must exist and be non-empty at the provided path.
- The feature branch `feat-{feature}` should exist or be created before invocation.

---

## What the Workflow Does

Phase sequence (not a runbook — see workflow script for mechanics):

`REQ review → FSPEC → TSPEC → DECISIONS (conditional) → PLAN → PROPERTIES → Implementation batches → PROPERTIES tests → Final codebase review → Harvest`

---

## Auto-Approved Batching Decision

Implementation batches (Phase I) execute automatically without user approval. Rationale: the batch plan is logged to `/workflows` before dispatch so the developer can observe it; auto-approval eliminates the human-in-the-loop latency that would stall background execution.

---

## Known Alternative: Two-Workflow Split

A two-workflow split (`orchestrate-spec` / `orchestrate-impl`) was considered and rejected. It would require the developer to manually invoke the second workflow after the first completes, reintroducing the manual coordination overhead that the single-workflow approach eliminates.

---

## Artifact Conventions

All artifacts live under `docs/{feature}/`. See CLAUDE.md §pdlc specifics for full naming conventions (REQ, FSPEC, TSPEC, DECISIONS, PLAN, PROPERTIES, LEARNINGS, CROSS-REVIEW-*, POSTMORTEM-*).

## Workflow Script Path

- Canonical plugin source: `pdlc/workflows/orchestrate-dev.js`
- Runtime-loaded consumer copy: `.claude/workflows/orchestrate-dev.js`

The consumer copy is a direct copy of the plugin source (no build step). Until a formal `pdlc install` mechanism exists, this copy is managed manually.
